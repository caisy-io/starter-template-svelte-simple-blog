## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
## Building
To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment. Right now we have the vercel adapter set up.
